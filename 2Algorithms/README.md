# Common Algorithms in JavaScript

##Testing

To run the tests yourself you'll need to download the project and install its node module dependencies via [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/).  So, if you haven't already installed [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and npm for use on your command line hop over to the Node.js website and follow their download and installation instructions.  Once you have Node.js and npm installed, clone the project onto your computer using the following command in your terminal/command prompt/console:

(Just in case you haven't already installed [Git](https://git-scm.com/), do so by following the installation instructions [here](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git), then enter the previous command again once it's installed.)  Once you've downloaded the project use the following command to navigate to the project's root directory:

Next, install the project's node module dependencies from npm.  Do so by entering this command:

`npm install`

Once all the dependencies are installed you'll be ready to run the tests.  Enter the following command to run them:

`npm test`

This repository uses [Travis-CI](https://travis-ci.org/sumtype/common-algorithms-js) for deployment testing on Node.js versions 6.9x and 7.2x.
