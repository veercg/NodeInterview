NodeJS interview questions

## IMPORTANT
Fork only! Please do so as instructed during the duration of the interview. We will evaluate based on the version of the repo you have forked. Git commit and git push to your forked repo as many times as necessary. Ask your interviewer if you require more information.

The following project is split into 4 parts:

 
## 1 Core (15mins)
## 2 Algorithms & Problem Solving (30mins)
## 3 Creativity (24hours)

### Prerequisites

System Requirements

```
Node JS LTS (v4.7 or v6.4)
NPM
Text Editor
Github account
```

### Navigation

The interview is split across 4 components. Each component as its own readme file.

1. Core:

```
Go through the google form included. Fill up and submit your chosen answers. You may submit your answers only once. 
```


3. Creativity:

```
Have a read through the README.md file in the '3Creativity' folder. It's a take home assignment so ask questions if necessary.
```

2. Algorithms:

```
Using Node and Mocha, try to pass as many test cases as possible. Google them up if you need to. The objective here is to 'peek' into your mind to discover how you think. Look at the test cases provided under the /test folder for guides on how to complete the functions.
